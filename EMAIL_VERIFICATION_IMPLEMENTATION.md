This implementation provides a complete email verification system for withdrawal requests, ensuring secure withdrawal processing through 6-digit verification codes sent via email.

## 🏗️ Implementation Architecture

### Backend Components Created

#### 1. Database Migration
**File:** `database/migrations/2025_08_27_000000_create_withdrawal_verification_codes_table.php`
- Creates `withdrawal_verification_codes` table
- Stores verification codes with expiration tracking
- Includes IP address and user agent for security
- Foreign key relationship with users table

#### 2. Model
**File:** `app/Models/WithdrawalVerificationCode.php`
- Manages verification code lifecycle
- Includes validation and expiration logic
- Provides helper methods for code generation and cleanup
- Implements security features like rate limiting

#### 3. Notification
**File:** `app/Notifications/WithdrawalEmailVerification.php`
- Handles email delivery of verification codes
- Supports both email and database notification channels
- Professional email template with clear instructions

#### 4. Controller
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/EmailVerificationController.php`
- RESTful API endpoints for verification flow
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Rate limiting and security measures implemented

#### 5. API Routes
**Routes added to:** `routes/api.php`
```php
Route::prefix('withdrawal')->middleware(['auth:sanctum'])->group(function () {
    Route::post('/send-verification-code', [EmailVerificationController::class, 'sendVerificationCode']);
    Route::post('/verify-code', [EmailVerificationController::class, 'verifyCode']);
    Route::post('/resend-verification-code', [EmailVerificationController::class, 'resendVerificationCode']);
    Route::get('/verification-status', [EmailVerificationController::class, 'checkVerificationStatus']);
});
```

## 📡 API Endpoints

### 1. Send Verification Code
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/withdrawal/send-verification-code`

**Request:**
```json
{
    "email": "user@example.com"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Verification code sent successfully",
    "masked_email": "us**@example.com",
    "verification_token": "unique-token-string",
    "expires_in_minutes": 15
}
```

### 2. Verify Code
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/withdrawal/verify-code`

**Request:**
```json
{
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "code": "123456"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Code verified successfully",
    "verification_token": "token-for-withdrawal",
    "verified": true
}
```

### 3. Resend Verification Code
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/withdrawal/resend-verification-code`

**Request:**
```json
{
    "email": "user@example.com"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "New verification code sent",
    "masked_email": "us**@example.com",
    "verification_token": "new-token-string",
    "expires_in_minutes": 15
}
```

### 4. Check Verification Status
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/withdrawal/verification-status?email=user@example.com`

**Response:**
```json
{
    "has_active_code": true,
    "expires_at": "2025-08-27T15:30:00Z",
    "can_resend": false,
    "next_resend_at": "2025-08-27T14:32:00Z"
}
```

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Rate Limiting
- Maximum 3 verification requests per 15 minutes per user
- Maximum 5 verification attempts per 15 minutes per user
- Prevents spam and brute force attacks

### Code Security
- 6-digit numeric codes (100,000 to 999,999)
- 15-minute expiration time
- Single-use codes (marked as used after verification)
- Automatic cleanup of expired/used codes

### Email Privacy
- Email masking in API responses (e.g., jo***@example.com)
- Secure token generation for verification tracking

### Request Validation
- CSRF protection
- IP address and user agent tracking
- Input sanitization and validation

## 🎨 Frontend Requirements

### EmailVerificationModal.vue (To be created)
Required features:
- 6-digit input field (numeric only)
- 15-second countdown timer
- Resend button (hidden during countdown)
- Masked email display
- Error handling and success states
- Loading states for API calls

### Integration with WithdrawalModal.vue
- Show email verification modal first
- On successful verification, show withdrawal form
- Pass verification token to withdrawal endpoint

## 🧪 Testing

### Backend Testing Complete
- ✅ Model functionality verified
- ✅ Notification system tested
- ✅ Database operations working
- ✅ API routes registered
- ✅ Controller logic validated
- ✅ Email masking functional
- ✅ Code generation and cleanup working

### Test Files Created
1. `test_email_verification.php` - Comprehensive backend testing
2. `test_api_endpoints.php` - API endpoint testing (requires frontend or API client)

## 📧 Email Configuration

The system uses Laravel's notification system. Ensure your `.env` file has proper mail configuration:

```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=your-smtp-host
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your-email
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=your-email
MAIL_FROM_NAME="WGCrowdfunding"
```

## 🔄 User Flow

1. **User clicks withdrawal button**
2. **Email verification modal appears with:**
   - 6-digit input field
   - Masked email display (e.g., "sh*********w@example.com")
   - 15-second countdown timer
   - Resend button (disabled during countdown)

3. **System sends verification email**
4. **User enters 6-digit code**
5. **On successful verification:**
   - Email verification modal closes
   - Withdrawal modal opens
   - Verification token is available for withdrawal request

6. **On failed verification:**
   - Error message shown
   - User can retry or resend code

## 🚀 Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed
- Database schema and migration
- Model with all required methods
- Notification system for emails
- API controller with all endpoints
- Route registration
- Security implementations
- Backend testing
- Email masking functionality

### 🔄 Next Steps
1. Create `EmailVerificationModal.vue` component
