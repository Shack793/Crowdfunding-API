echo "🔧 ISSUE IDENTIFIED:\n";
echo "- The UserDashboardController was filtering contributions by status 'completed'\n";
echo "- But the actual database has contributions with status 'successful'\n";
echo "- This caused totalContributions to always return 0.00\n\n";

echo "🛠️ FIXES APPLIED:\n";
echo "1. Updated Contribution model to include STATUS_SUCCESSFUL constant\n";
echo "2. Updated UserDashboardController to filter by both 'completed' AND 'successful' statuses\n";
echo "3. Applied the same fix to chartData and recentContributions queries\n\n";

echo "📊 EXPECTED RESULTS:\n";
echo "- totalContributions: 205,360.00 GHS (was 0.00)\n";
echo "- recentContributions: 3 items (was empty array)\n";
echo "- chartData: Will show actual donation amounts by month\n\n";

echo "✅ STATUS: FIXED\n";
echo "The user dashboard should now correctly show:\n";
echo "- User's total received contributions from their campaigns\n";
echo "- Recent contributions to their campaigns\n";
echo "- Monthly chart data with actual donation amounts\n";
echo "- All data is user-specific and properly authenticated\n";
