# User Dashboard API Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The `/api/v1/userdashboard` endpoint was returning global statistics (all campaigns, all contributions, all withdrawals) instead of user-specific data. This caused:

1. **Incorrect total contributions count** - showing global contributions instead of contributions to the user's campaigns
2. **Missing user context** - no `user_id`, `walletStats`, or `withdrawalHistory`
3. **Security issue** - any authenticated user could see global statistics

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated UserDashboardController.php
**File:** `app/Http/Controllers/UserDashboardController.php`

**Key Changes:**
- Added `Request $request` parameter to get authenticated user
- Changed all queries to be user-specific:
  - `totalCampaigns`: Only count campaigns created by the authenticated user
  - `totalContributions`: Only sum contributions received on user's campaigns (not contributions made by the user)
  - `withdrawals`: Only sum withdrawals made by the authenticated user
  - `expiredCampaigns`: Only count expired campaigns belonging to the user

### 2. Added Wallet Integration
- Get or create user's wallet automatically
- Return complete wallet statistics including:
  - Current balance
  - Total withdrawn amount
  - Withdrawal count
  - Currency
  - Last withdrawal date
  - Wallet status

### 3. Enhanced Data Structure
- Added `user_id` to response
- Added `walletStats` object
- Added `withdrawalHistory` array with recent withdrawals
- Updated `chartData` to show user-specific monthly data
- Updated `recentContributions` to show contributions to user's campaigns

### 4. Fixed Route Indentation
**File:** `routes/api.php`
- Fixed inconsistent indentation for the userdashboard route
- Ensured proper middleware protection

## API Response Structure (After Fix)

```json
{
    "user_id": 1,
    "totalCampaigns": 1,
    "totalContributions": "125.50",
    "withdrawals": "50.00",
    "expiredCampaigns": 0,
    "walletStats": {
        "balance": "75.50",
        "total_withdrawn": "50.00",
        "withdrawal_count": 2,
        "currency": "GHS",
        "last_withdrawal_at": "2025-08-13T10:41:26.000000Z",
        "status": "active"
    },
    "withdrawalHistory": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "amount": "50.00",
            "status": "completed",
            "date": "2025-08-13",
            "created_at": "2025-08-13T10:41:26.000000Z"
        }
    ],
    "chartData": [...],
    "recentContributions": [...]
}
```

## Business Logic Fix

### Critical Issue Resolved:
**Total Contributions Logic**: The API now correctly shows contributions **received** on the user's campaigns (money donated TO their campaigns), not contributions **made** by the user (money they donated to others). This is essential because:

1. Users should see how much money their campaigns have raised
2. Withdrawals can only be made from money raised by their own campaigns
3. The wallet balance should reflect earnings from their campaigns

### Authentication Requirement:
- The endpoint now properly requires authentication (returns 401 if no valid token)
- Each user sees only their own data
- No security leaks of other users' information

## Benefits
1. ✅ **Correct contribution counting** - Shows actual money raised by user's campaigns
2. ✅ **User-specific data** - Each user sees only their own statistics
3. ✅ **Wallet integration** - Complete wallet information and withdrawal history
4. ✅ **Security** - No access to other users' data
5. ✅ **Business logic** - Proper relationship between contributions and withdrawals

## Testing
- Endpoint correctly returns HTTP 401 when not authenticated
- Ready for testing with valid authentication tokens
- All relationships properly implemented using Eloquent models
